package main

// All files in the same directory must belong to the same package.

// When Go compiles a package, it expects all files in that directory to be part of the same package, which means they must share the same package declaration at the top of each file.

func main() {
//     a1:=users.User{"Salsjam","sakn"}
//     fmt.Println(a1)
